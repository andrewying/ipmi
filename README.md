# Adsisto

&copy; Andrew Ying 2019.

A web-accessable IPMI / IP KVM system that provides full keyboard control, monitor view, and and the ability to reboot computers with standard motherboards remotely as if you were sitting in front of them with a keyboard and monitor. Based on the project by @Fmstrat.

Adsisto is written in Go and React, and is designed to have a small fingerprint
and to run on single-broad computers.
